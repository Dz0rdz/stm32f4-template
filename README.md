# This is a quick little template made for the STM32F4 microcontroller.

This demo will blink the LED's on the discovery development kit. Change 
main.c if you want to use others.

This project was created by me, but draws on the work of many others :D. 
Feel free to use this as you like, as others
projects have helped me, but do please let me know if it helps you along 
at all, it's nice to know :).

# ENJOY!
